        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>VR Escape Room</h3>
            <p>I made an escape room with 3 puzzles where the challenge was to fit everything into one room as the player was not allowed to move.
                During this project, I learned how to work with interactables and sockets for items in vr. I also learned to make my own models and how to use collidor and rigidbodies</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>VR Rhythm Game</h3>
            <p>I was tasked to make a Rhythm game similar to Beat Saber. During this project I learned about rigging models and how to make and use animations in Unity. I also learned how to use Controller physics values such as angle of movement and velocity and how to implement them in C#  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Football Manager in terminal (Group Project)</h3>
            <p>We made a complete football manager in terminal using java. This helped me learn various techniques in Java and helped me get better at the language.</p>
